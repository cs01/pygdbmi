It is specifically intended to support the development of systems which use the debugger as just one small component of a larger system. What's in the box? A function to parse gdb machine interface string output and return structured data types (Python dicts) that are JSON serializable. Useful for writing the backend to a gdb frontend. For example, gdbgui uses pygdbmi on the backend. A Python class to control and interact with gdb as a subprocess To get machine interface output from gdb, run gdb with the --interpreter=mi2 flag like so: gdb --interpreter=mi2 Installation pip install pygdbmi Compatibility Operating Systems Cross platform support for Linux, macOS and Windows Linux/Unix Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 have been tested to work. Other versions likely work as well. macOS Note: the error please check gdb is codesigned - see taskgated(8) can be fixed by codesigning gdb with these instructions . If the error is not fixed, please create an issue in github . Windows Windows 10 has been tested to work with MinGW and cygwin. gdb versions gdb 7.6+ has been tested. Older versions may work as well. Examples gdb mi defines a syntax for its output that is suitable for machine readability and scripting: example output : -> - break - insert main <- ^ done , bkpt = { number = \"1\" , type = \"breakpoint\" , disp = \"keep\" , enabled = \"y\" , addr = \"0x08048564\" , func = \"main\" , file = \"myprog.c\" , fullname = \"/home/myprog.c\" , line = \"68\" , thread - groups = [ \"i1\" ], times = \"0\" } <- ( gdb ) Use pygdbmi.gdbmiparser.parse_response to turn that string output into a JSON serializable dictionary from pygdbmi import gdbmiparser from pprint import pprint response = gdbmiparser . parse_response ( '^done,bkpt={number=\"1\",type=\"breakpoint\",disp=\"keep\", enabled=\"y\",addr=\"0x08048564\",func=\"main\",file=\"myprog.c\",fullname=\"/home/myprog.c\",line=\"68\",thread-groups=[\"i1\"],times=\"0\"' ) pprint ( response ) > { 'message' : 'done' , 'payload' : { 'bkpt' : { 'addr' : '0x08048564' , 'disp' : 'keep' , 'enabled' : 'y' , 'file' : 'myprog.c' , 'fullname' : '/home/myprog.c' , 'func' : 'main' , 'line' : '68' , 'number' : '1' , 'thread-groups' : [ 'i1' ], 'times' : '0' , 'type' : 'breakpoint' }}, 'type' : 'result' } Programmatic Control Over gdb But how do you get the gdb output into Python in the first place? If you want, pygdbmi also has a class to control gdb as subprocess. You can write commands, and get structured output back: from pygdbmi.gdbcontroller import GdbController from pprint import pprint # Start gdb process gdbmi = GdbController () print ( gdbmi . get_subprocess_cmd ()) # print actual command run as subprocess # Load binary a.out and get structured response response = gdbmi . write ( '-file-exec-file a.out' ) pprint ( response ) [{ 'message' : u 'thread-group-added' , 'payload' : { u 'id' : u 'i1' }, 'type' : 'notify' }, { 'message' : u 'done' , 'payload' : None , 'type' : 'result' }] Now do whatever you want with gdb. All gdb commands, as well as gdb machine interface commands are acceptable. gdb mi commands give better structured output that is machine readable, rather than gdb console output. mi commands begin with a - . response = gdbmi . write ( '-break-insert main' ) # machine interface (MI) commands start with a '-' response = gdbmi . write ( 'break main' ) # normal gdb commands work too, but the return value is slightly different response = gdbmi . write ( '-exec-run' ) response = gdbmi . write ( 'run' ) response = gdbmi . write ( '-exec-next' , timeout_sec = 0.1 ) # the wait time can be modified from the default of 1 second response = gdbmi . write ( 'next' ) response = gdbmi . write ( 'next' , raise_error_on_timeout = False ) response = gdbmi . write ( 'next' , raise_error_on_timeout = True , timeout_sec = 0.01 ) response = gdbmi . write ( '-exec-continue' ) response = gdbmi . send_signal_to_gdb ( 'SIGKILL' ) # name of signal is okay response = gdbmi . send_signal_to_gdb ( 2 ) # value of signal is okay too response = gdbmi . interrupt_gdb () # sends SIGINT to gdb response = gdbmi . write ( 'continue' ) response = gdbmi . exit () Parsed Output Format Each parsed gdb response consists of a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has keys message , payload , token , and type . message contains a textual message from gdb, which is not always present. When missing, this is None . payload contains the content of gdb's output, which can contain any of the following: dictionary , list , string . This too is not always present, and can be None depending on the response. token If an input command was prefixed with a (optional) token then the corresponding output for that command will also be prefixed by that same token. This field is only present for pygdbmi output types nofity and result . When missing, this is None . The type is defined based on gdb's various mi output record types , and can be result - the result of a gdb command, such as done , running , error , etc. notify - additional async changes that have occurred, such as breakpoint modified console - textual responses to cli commands log - debugging messages from gdb's internals output - output from target target - output from remote target done - when gdb has finished its output Contributing Documentation fixes, bug fixes, performance improvements, and functional improvements are welcome.
